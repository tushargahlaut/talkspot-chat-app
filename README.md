# Talkspot - Chat in Real Time

This is a MERN Stack Web application I created which allows users to create their accounts and start chatting with their friends, be it a 1-1 chat, or in a group.
The motivation behind this project was to learn about websockets and help me in gaining insight on how popular chatting systems such as Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger Work.

I used socket.io library for establishing real time connection between users so that they can receive/send messages in real time.
It also has notification system, if an user is on a different chat room and someone messages him, he can get real time notification about the same.

I also learned how to use Tailwind CSS, I will try to add more UI Features in this website the more I learn.

I have used Redux-Toolkit for majority part of handling User Data, and used Next.Js for developing frontend.

If you want to try this project out, clone this repo, run npm install command on both main folder and frontend folder and run "npm start" to run backend server, and "cd frontend npm run dev" to run frontend.
